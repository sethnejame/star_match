# The Star Match Game

The star match game is a simple web app that requires the player to use math skills to complete each level. App was coded by Seth NeJame via the following tutorial: 

Plural Sight - Getting Started w/ React by Samer Buna

## The Star Match Game is deployed via GH-Pages:
https://sethnejame.github.io/star_match/
1. The game will start with a random amount of stars on the left hand side of the browser window and a number pad to the right of the browser window
2. The goal of the game is to use the number pad on the right of the window to total the amount of stars on the left side of the window within the given time limit.  The stars will generate randomly until you have selected all available numbers
3. The game is timed, so the best strategy to complete this game would be to choose as many numbers as possible to total the number of stars displayed.  For instance, if you were shown 8 stars, it would be prudent to select the numbers 4, 3, and 1 instead of just the number 8.  Stars will continue to generate until you get rid of the remaining numbers.

Good luck!

## Project Details

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
